QUICK START: Getting AFM Images for Your Portfolio
===================================================

FASTEST METHOD (5 minutes):
---------------------------

1. Go to: https://www.afmworkshop.com/applications/atomic-force-microscopy-images/thin-films

2. Find any periodic structure image (gratings, arrays, films)

3. Right-click → Save Image As → Save to your computer

4. Go to your portfolio: http://localhost:3006/case-studies/afm-vision

5. Upload the image using the file picker

6. Adjust the "nm per pixel" slider (try values between 5-20)

7. Watch the tool automatically:
   - Calculate the grating pitch
   - Show defects in red overlay
   - Display FFT analysis results


RECOMMENDED IMAGES TO TRY:
---------------------------

From AFMWorkshop:
- Indium Tin Oxide on glass (periodic structure)
- Silver thin films (surface features)
- Any grating or array pattern

From Asylum Research Gallery (afm.oxinst.com/gallery/):
- Semiconductor periodic arrays
- Thin film samples
- Nanostructure images


GENERATE YOUR OWN (if you have Python + PIL):
----------------------------------------------

cd public/sample-afm-images
pip3 install Pillow numpy
python3 generate-test-images.py

This creates 3 test images simulating:
- 623nm pitch circular grating
- 668nm pitch circular grating  
- 717nm pitch circular grating


WHAT TO EXPECT:
----------------

The AFM-Vision tool will:
✓ Analyze spatial frequencies via FFT
✓ Estimate the grating pitch in nanometers
✓ Overlay potential defects in red
✓ Compare to theoretical pitch values (623/668/717 nm)


TROUBLESHOOTING:
-----------------

- Image too small? Try larger images (>256x256 pixels)
- Wrong pitch? Adjust the nm/pixel scale slider
- No defects shown? Image might be very uniform
- Upload fails? Ensure file is JPG, PNG, or BMP format
